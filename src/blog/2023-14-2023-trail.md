title: How I got started with Graphic Design
description: "It was almost an accident that I landed and got started with
  photoshop  but I didn't know it was a strategy then but I kept trying to do
  one particular thing that led to me doing another thing to another thing; fast
  forward I am called a graphic designer. "
